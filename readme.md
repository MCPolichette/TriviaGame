### Titled : BEER TRIVIA

Created with intentions to learn more about timeouts, and intervals in javascript

### Motivation

In this project I wanted to work more with understanding classes with bootstrap, and integrating javascript code to make the experience seem smooth and engaging. I wanted to work with objects to better understand their functioning. and learn to work using more complicated actions.

#### To Play

![ScreenShot](/images/readMePics/CountDown.PNG)
The game starts with a single button to start. upon clicking the start, the game will begin asking multiple choice questions, while also displaying a countdown timer. Each answer has a specific image attached to it, which will be displayed if answered correctly. If the answer is wrong, it will display a random "losing image".

After a specified amount of questions, a scoreboard will apear, showing the totals of how many answers were correct, wrong, and unanswered.

it will also display a button to restart gameplay.
